Our project is an ECG waveform output and display heart monitor.The difficult task is to make
the small range of the ECG voltage signal: 0.1 mV to 10mV, which is significantly impacted by
noise.This is accomplished by a leg drive circuit, an a high pass filter, an instrumentation
amplifier,both a notch filter and a low pass filter were utilized. 160 Hz was the bandwidth that was
taken into consideration. Attaining this requires only analog electronic parts were employed.
electronic digital elements were exclusively utilized in the digital circuit, breadboard, and
simulation testing testing was carried out, along with PCB testing. the circuitâ€™s functionality. An
3D enclosure was created and constructed to meet the requirements.
